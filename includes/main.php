    <h2>Young Code</h2>
    <i>Find, Share, Socialize</i>
    <p>With young code we help you find people with your interests in your area. On our map we insert your approximate location data so that people can see in which area you are.</p>
    <p>Young Code is a place where people that are new to coding can come together, help each other with basic questions, without getting hate for incompetence.</p>
